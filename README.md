# Repository created for Capturing my GoLang Learning.

## Key Observations:
* Package name should be `main` for executables
* `go run <filename>` for build and run
* `go build <filename>` for executable
* `//` for single line comment and `/** ...*/` for multiline comment
* switch statement will stop executing once the condition case is matched and will not evaluate any further cases, switch case does not need break statement
* Go lang Arrays are `Pass-By-Value`


## Topics covered
